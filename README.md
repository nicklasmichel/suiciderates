# suiciderates

This repository covers a small data science project posted on medium (https://medium.com/@nicklas.a.michel/facts-figures-on-suicide-rates-76428da844f0).

The blog answers three key questions related to worldwide suicide rates. 

1.) Where do the least/most suicides take place?

2.) Are men more suicidal than women?

3.) Is a countryâ€™s suicide rate related to its size, income or HDI?

To do so, (visualized) descriptive statistics and correlations with socio-economic factors are presented. The underlying data is published by the Word Health Organization.
